	<h2>The Start </h2>
	<article>
	<h2> When did I first get into running? </h2>
	<h4> In Auguest of 2014, with zero race experiance and improper traning
	I completed my first half marathon</h4> I soon found this atheletic sport something I wanted to do. The feeling of passing the
	finish line was something that I've never experianced before.
	<br>
	<br>
	<b> 13.1 miles later</b> I was already ready to sign up for my next race. This was just the start of a hobby I soon fell in love with. 
	</article>
	
	<h2>What was next? </h2>
	<h4> The <mark class= "blue">goal</mark> to Complete a 1/2 Marathon under 1hr:45 minutes </h4>
	<p> Soon after my first race, I decided to sign up for mulitple 10ks (6.2 mile races) in hopes to better improve myself as runner. About one year later, I signed up for the <span style= "color: steelblue">
	Redmond Labor Day Half Marathon.</span>
	<br>
	<br>
	With the hopes to achieve my goal, unfortunately I fell short, running a 1hr 47 minute race. Dissapointed in myself, it took me 2 more race atempts till I got a PR (personal record) at the end of 2015. 
	<br> 
	<br>
	What i learned from that experiance was, you will get the results based on how much effort you put in. <b>Persistance</b> is key and so is <b>hard work</b>.

	<h2> The <b> Marathon </b> </h2>
	<h4> 2 years after my first race, I signed up for the Walt Disney World Marathon.</h4>
	<p>In January 2016, I completed the Walt Disney World Marathon and would later complete the Seattle Rock n Roll Full Marathon in June. Ever since then I have
	ran the <b>Walt Disney World Marathon</b> and <b>Dopey Challenge</b> every year.</p>

	<h2> The Finish Line </h2>
	<h4> What I learned from my few years of running, is that even when you past that finish line. The race is just getting <span style = "color: green"> started. </span></h4>
	Running is not for everyone, but it is a good form of exercise that is free and can be practiced from any skill range and any age.
	<br> 
	<br>
	It taught me many life skills in which I use everyday and how <b>strong</b> the mind can be once you push your limits.
