		<article style="border:1px solid lightgray;padding:16px;">
			<h3>Week 1: A Tour of London</h3>
			<h4><i>Highlights: surviving Trafalgar Square, getting kicked out of Buckingham Palace, ringing the doorbell at 
			No. 10 Downing Street</i></h4>
			<p>	
			<b>After landing at Heathrow</b>, I rode the Tube to my hotel, dropped off my bag, and hit the ground running.
			First stop: The Natural History Museum, where I checked out all the dinosaur skeletons and took a small souvenir 
			for my dog Marley back in Seattle.  For lunch, I grabbed some bangers and mash at a pub called The Jolly Slophouse, 
			then went on a guided tour of the Tower of London. Fed the pigeons in Hyde Park. Took in a Shakespeare play at the 
			Globe theater but didn't understand a word of it. I think someone said "Forsooth".</p>

		<h4><i>Highlights: Getting lost in </i>les Catacombes<i>, putting lipstick on the Mona Lisa, dropping water balloons 
        from the Eiffel Tower</i></h4>
		<p>
    	<b>What a busy week it was!</b> I toured the Louvre. I jogged the Champs-Elys&eacute;es from the Arc de Triomphe 
        to the Tuileries Garden and ran over 5 poodles. I cruised the Seine River and was attacked by a swan.  
        I went to a flea market and bought a chamberpot used by Napoleon Bonaparte (or so I was told). I ate lots of
        baguettes, crepes, truffles, and creme brulee. I learned how to say Alka-Seltzer in French.

		<dl>
    	<dt><b>French: <i>Excusez-moi! Est ce-que vous parlez anglais?</i></b></dt>
        <dd>Excuse me, I am totally clueless and don't speak of word of French. Can you help me out here?</dd>
        <dt><b>German: <i>Entschuldigen Sie! Sprechen Sie English?</i></b></dt>
        <dd>I'm so embarrassed, I left my German phrasebook at the hotel and as you can see, I'm lost without it.</dd>
        <dt><b>Polish: <i>Przepraszam! Czy m&oacute;wi pan po angielsku?</i></b></dt>
        <dd>How's your English? Sorry, I'd just sprain my tongue if I tried to speak your language...</dd>
