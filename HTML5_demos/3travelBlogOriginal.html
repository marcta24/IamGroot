	<h2 style="color:steelblue">Week 1: A Tour of London</h2>
    <h4><i>Highlights: surviving Trafalgar Square, getting kicked out of Buckingham Palace, ringing the doorbell at 
        No. 10 Downing Street</i></h4>
	<p>	
		<b>After landing at Heathrow</b>, I rode the Tube to my hotel, dropped off my bag, and hit the ground running.
        First stop: The Natural History Museum, where I checked out all the dinosaur skeletons and took a small souvenir 
        for my dog Marley back in Seattle.  For lunch, I grabbed some bangers and mash at a pub called The Jolly Slophouse, 
        then went on a guided tour of the Tower of London. Fed the pigeons in Hyde Park. Took in a Shakespeare play at the 
        Globe theater but didn't understand a word of it. I think someone said "Forsooth".

    <h4><i>Highlights: Getting lost in </i>les Catacombes<i>, putting lipstick on the Mona Lisa, dropping water balloons 
        from the Eiffel Tower</i></h4>
	<p>
    	<b>What a busy week it was!</b> I toured the Louvre. I jogged the Champs-Elys&eacute;es from the Arc de Triomphe 
        to the Tuileries Garden and ran over 5 poodles. I cruised the Seine River and was attacked by a swan.  
        I went to a flea market and bought a chamberpot used by Napoleon Bonaparte (or so I was told). I ate lots of
        baguettes, crepes, truffles, and creme brulee. I learned how to say Alka-Seltzer in French.
